## üìã Code Standards

### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript settings
- Define interfaces for all props and data structures
- Avoid `any` types - use proper typing
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use proper error boundaries for robustness

### Code Style
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Add comments for complex algorithms
- Keep functions small and focused

### Performance
- Optimize for mobile devices
- Use React.memo for expensive renders
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect
- Consider memory usage with large video files

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing
- Test on both desktop and mobile devices
- Verify video upload with different formats
- Test the complete analysis workflow
- Check performance with real skating videos

### Code Testing
- Test TypeScript compilation: `npm run type-check`
- Test production build: `npm run build`
- Verify no console errors in browser
- Test offline functionality (PWA features)
