- Air time precision measurement
- Compare against professional FineFS benchmarks

#### 3. MediaPipe Model Maker Workflow
**Training Process**:
```
FineFS Dataset → MediaPipe Model Maker → Specialized .tflite → On-Device Inference
```

**Steps**:
1. **Data Preparation**: Organize FineFS annotations (1,167 samples with ISU scoring)
2. **Base Model Loading**: Use pre-trained MediaPipe Pose as foundation  
3. **DoRA Fine-tuning**: Apply Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation
4. **Export**: Generate optimized .tflite model (~5-10MB)
5. **Integration**: Deploy via Core ML or MediaPipe Task APIs

#### 4. On-Device Performance Benefits

## 🎯 Implementation Roadmap: Automatic Takeoff/Landing Detection

### Phase 1: Manual Baseline (Current) ✅
- User manually marks takeoff/landing frames
- Provides ground truth for validation
- Immediate value for users while we build automation

### Phase 2: Coarse Detection with Mayupei Model
**Integration Steps**:
1. Convert mayupei's PyTorch model to TensorFlow Lite
2. Integrate into app as "jump window detector"
3. Use LSTM-CNN to identify rough jump boundaries

**Output**: "Jump occurring between frames 120-180"

### Phase 3: Precise Frame Detection with Kinematics
**Within detected window, analyze**:

```javascript
// Pseudocode for precise detection
function findTakeoffFrame(poseData, startFrame, endFrame) {
  for (frame = startFrame; frame < endFrame; frame++) {
    const ankleY = poseData[frame].leftAnkle.y;
    const prevAnkleY = poseData[frame-1].leftAnkle.y;
    const velocity = ankleY - prevAnkleY;
    
    // Takeoff: sudden upward acceleration
    if (velocity > TAKEOFF_THRESHOLD && 
        isGroundContact(frame-1) && 
        !isGroundContact(frame+1)) {
      return frame;
    }
  }
}

function findLandingFrame(poseData, takeoffFrame, endFrame) {
  for (frame = takeoffFrame + MIN_AIR_TIME; frame < endFrame; frame++) {
    const ankleY = poseData[frame].leftAnkle.y;
    
    // Landing: return to ground level with deceleration
    if (isGroundContact(frame) && 
        wasInAir(frame-1) &&
        kneeFlexionIncreasing(frame)) {
      return frame;
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Detection Signals**:
- **Takeoff**: 
  - Vertical velocity spike (>2m/s)
  - Ankle Y-position rapid increase
  - Hip-knee-ankle angle changes (preparation)
  - Last frame with ground contact

- **Landing**:
  - Ankle returns to ice level (±5cm)
  - Knee flexion begins (shock absorption)
  - Vertical velocity becomes negative→zero
  - First frame with stable ground contact

### Phase 4: Validation & Refinement
- Compare auto-detection with manual ground truth
- Fine-tune thresholds based on skating-specific dynamics
- Handle edge cases (fall landings, step-outs, two-foot landings)

### Phase 5: Production Deployment
**Progressive Rollout**:
1. **Beta Mode**: Show auto-detected frames with confidence scores
2. **Assisted Mode**: Auto-detect but allow manual adjustment
3. **Full Auto**: High-confidence automatic detection
4. **Fallback**: Revert to manual if confidence low

**Expected Accuracy Timeline**:
- Phase 2: 85% correct (±3 frames)
- Phase 3: 95% correct (±1 frame)
- Phase 4: 98% correct (exact frame)

### Technical Benefits of This Approach
- **Leverage Existing Research**: Don't reinvent the wheel
- **Fail Gracefully**: Always have manual fallback
- **Ship Incrementally**: Each phase adds value
- **Learn from Users**: Manual markings become training data
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Kinematics are computationally cheap

### Implementation Details

#### Phase 1: Automated Data Labeling
```python
# Run once on powerful workstation
def prepare_training_data():
    lstm_cnn = load_mayupei_model()
    
    for video in all_skating_videos:
        # Step 1: LSTM-CNN provides rough labels
        coarse_labels = lstm_cnn.predict(video)
        
        # Step 2: Kinematic refinement for precision
        for jump in coarse_labels.jumps:
            precise_takeoff = refine_with_physics(
                jump.window, 
                signal="vertical_velocity_spike"
            )
            precise_landing = refine_with_physics(
                jump.window,
                signal="ground_contact_restored"  
            )
            
            # Step 3: Save enhanced labels
            training_labels.append({
                'video': video.id,
                'takeoff_frame': precise_takeoff,
                'landing_frame': precise_landing,
                'jump_type': jump.type
            })
    
    return training_labels  # 10,000+ labeled jumps
```

#### Phase 2: MediaPipe Enhancement
```python
# Train MediaPipe with additional output heads
model_maker = MediaPipeModelMaker()

# Load base pose model
base_model = model_maker.load_pretrained('pose_detection')

# Add custom output heads for skating
model_maker.add_classification_head('jump_phase', classes=4)
model_maker.add_regression_head('takeoff_confidence')  
model_maker.add_regression_head('landing_confidence')

# Train with our auto-labeled dataset
enhanced_model = model_maker.train(
    data=training_labels,
    epochs=50,
    optimization='DoRA'  # Use efficient fine-tuning
)

# Export for mobile
enhanced_model.export('skating_pose.tflite')  # ~8MB
```

#### Phase 3: Mobile Runtime
```typescript
// Single model inference on iPhone
async function analyzeFrame(videoFrame: VideoFrame) {
    const result = await skatingPose.detect(videoFrame);
    
    // All predictions from ONE model in ONE pass
    return {
        // Standard pose (unchanged performance)
        skeleton: result.landmarks,
        
        // New skating-specific outputs (minimal overhead)
        takeoffConfidence: result.outputs.takeoff_confidence,
        landingConfidence: result.outputs.landing_confidence,
        jumpPhase: result.outputs.jump_phase,
        
        // Computed in ~15ms on iPhone 12
    };
}
```
